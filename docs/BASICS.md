## Hello, Phi!

The typical “Hello, World” is written as follows.

print "Hello, Phi!"

## Data types

Phi supports values of familiar types like Int, Double, String and Bool. Additionally, there is a special type Unit to express the absence of value (similar to void in Java) and all types in Phi inherit from a supertype Object.

## Declaring & defining variables

As simple as:

```
var = 0
```

_You can't declare a variable without value._

Multiple declaration at the same line:

```
a, b, c = 0, 1, 2
```

Where the nth variable will get the nth value.
